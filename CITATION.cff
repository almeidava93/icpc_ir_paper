  Background: Medical coding is an essential process to
  collect structured data in healthcare. The International
  Classification of Primary Care, 2nd edition (ICPC-2), is
  more concise and appropriate for primary care compared to
  other classifications. However, healthcare professionals
  still struggle to correctly attribute codes in various
  clinical scenarios. Modern tools are necessary to help
  efficiently and accurately find the right codes. This
  study’s goal was to evaluate and compare three different
  information retrieval algorithms for retrieving ICPC-2
  codes. 

  Methods: Three different strategies for information
  retrieval were compared. The strategies include BM25,
  Levenshtein distance, and semantic search with embeddings
  from Large Language Models (LLMs) from different
  providers. As embedding models, we included models from
  OpenAI (text-embedding- ada-002, text-embedding-3-small,
  and text-embedding-3-large), Cohere
  (embed-multilingual-v2.0, and embed-multilingual-v3.0 with
  the subtypes search_document, search_query,
  classification, and clustering), and Gemini (embedding-001
  with the subtypes semantic_similarity, retrieval_query,
  retrieval_document, classification, and clustering). An
  official thesaurus for ICPC-2 codes in Brazilian
  Portuguese was used to develop a search engine. It was
  made publicly available and shared through social media
  with primary care professionals for data collection. A
  total of 11,868 queries were collected, of which 7,671
  (64.6%) were unique. A random sample of 437 unique
  expressions (5.7% of the unique queries) was annotated
  with ICPC- 2 through peer review. Annotation involved
  selecting the relevant ICPC-2 codes for each query. After
  this process, 398 entries (5.2% of the unique queries)
  were included in the evaluation dataset. Precision at k
  (P@k) and average precision at k (AP@k) were used as
  evaluation metrics, computed for each query and averaged
  over all queries. The analysis was conducted in a sample
  both weighted and non-weighted for query frequency.
  Analysis of variance (ANOVA) one-way and Tukey’s tests
  were used for hypothesis testing. 

  Results: The evaluation dataset with 398 queries encoded
  with ICPC-2 was used to evaluate the results of the three
  different information retrieval algorithms and of the
  different models. Semantic search with embeddings from
  LLMs outperformed BM25 and Levenshtein distance in all
  assessed metrics: P@1, P@5, P@10, AP@1, AP@5, AP@10 (P
  value <0.001). When comparing different embedding models,
  the OpenAI model performed better than the others in most
  metrics. The OpenAI model text-embedding-3-large showed at
  least one relevant result in the top 10 in 85.7% of the
  queries in the non-weighted sample and in 81.4% of the
  queries in the weighted sample. The BM25 algorithm
  combined with query preprocessing performed similarly to
  the semantic search in the AP@5 and AP@10 metrics. 

  Conclusions: Semantic search with embeddings from LLMs
  seems to perform better than BM25 and Levenshtein distance
  for retrieving ICPC-2 codes in the Brazilian Portuguese
  language. It is a promising approach for aiding healthcare
  professionals in medical coding. The BM25 algorithm
  combined with query preprocessing is an interesting option
  that can perform similarly to semantic search in some
  metrics, although it has some additional limitations.
